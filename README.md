**This file contains only some notes:** 

- This tool is meant primarily for bug hunnters (specially beginers).
- This tool is not backdoored , do not speak about viruses if you do not know how to catch/stop them.
- This tool contains bugs more than features so use it carefully.
- Connections are issued using  the .Net (SystemDotWeb) which is  slow and limited by design , consider using many threads, this will be replaced with another solution.
- Memory is not carefully managed so be carefull , do not use all the tools at the same time.
- Do not use it illegally 
- Tools starting with _ are not built yet , i added buttons to remmember so i could build them in distant future, hence no need to reverse engineer the tool in order to enable them , if you have time feel free to do it no problem.
- Many third-parties are used without permitssion no APIS used.
- The source code is not published because the tool is a beta and the code is uggly and worse than my hand writing.
- You do not need to report about bugs or crashes  , they will be fixed in later versions if there is a chance.
- Suggestions are deeply welcome. 
- Credits are reserved for all authors and third-parties.
